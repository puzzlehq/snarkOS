/// This data structure is used by validators to advertise the blocks that
/// they have and can provide to other validators to help them sync.
/// Periodically, each validator broadcasts a [`PrimaryPing`],
/// which contains a `BlockLocators` instance.
/// Recall that blocks are indexed by their `u32` height, starting with 0 for the genesis block.
/// The keys of the `recents` and `checkpoints` maps are the block heights;
/// the values of the maps are the corresponding block hashes.
///
/// If a validator has `N` blocks, the `recents` and `checkpoints` maps are as follows:
/// - The `recents` map contains entries for blocks at heights
///   `N - 1 - (NUM_RECENT_BLOCKS - 1) * RECENT_INTERVAL`,
///   `N - 1 - (NUM_RECENT_BLOCKS - 2) * RECENT_INTERVAL`,
///   ...,
///   `N - 1`.
///   If any of the just listed heights are negative, there are no entries for them of course,
///   and the `recents` map has fewer than `NUM_RECENT_BLOCKS` entries.
///   If `RECENT_INTERVAL` is 1, the `recents` map contains entries
///   for the last `NUM_RECENT_BLOCKS` blocks, i.e. from `N - NUM_RECENT_BLOCKS` to `N - 1`;
///   if additionally `N < NUM_RECENT_BLOCKS`, the `recents` map contains
///   entries for all the blocks, from `0` to `N - 1`.
/// - The `checkpoints` map contains an entry for every `CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL`-th block,
///   starting with 0 and not exceeding `N`, i.e. it has entries for blocks
///   `0`, `CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL`, `2 * CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL`, ..., `k * CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL`,
///   where `k` is the maximum integer such that `k * CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL <= N`.
///
/// The `recents` and `checkpoints` maps may have overlapping entries,
/// e.g. if `N-1` is a multiple of `CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL`;
/// but if `CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL` is much larger than `NUM_RECENT_BLOCKS`,
/// there is no overlap most of the time.
///
/// We call `BlockLocators` with the form described above 'well-formed'.
///
/// Well-formed `BlockLocators` instances are built by [`BlockSync::get_block_locators()`].
/// When a `BlockLocators` instance is received (in a [`PrimaryPing`]) by a validator,
/// the maps may not be well-formed (if the sending validator is faulty),
/// but the receiving validator ensures that they are well-formed
/// by calling [`BlockLocators::ensure_is_valid()`] from [`BlockLocators::new()`],
/// when deserializing in [`BlockLocators::read_le()`].
/// So this well-formedness is an invariant of `BlockLocators` instances.
